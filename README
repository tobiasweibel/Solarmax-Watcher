Author and license
------------------

A simple solarmax visualizer php program written by zagibu <zagibu@gmx.ch> in July 2010
This program was originally licensed under WTFPL 2 http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
Improvements and enhancements by Frank Lassowski <flassowski@gmx.de> in August/September 2010
Further improvements by sleepprogger <wwrStuff@gmx.de> in January 2012

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

See INSTALL file.

 
How it works
------------

This logging solution is composed of two main parts. The first part is the smw-logger, which reads the
figures over ethernet from the Solarmax inverters. It's written in "C" and works as a deamon during the day.

The second part is a php programm to visualize all the data, which were collected by the smw-logger.


ToDo-list
---------

Improvements and planed bug-fixes for the future:

- improvements for better use with more than one inverter
- addition of an init.d-script to handle the activation of the logger in collaboration with an watchdog-script
