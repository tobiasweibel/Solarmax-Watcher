This is a simple set of shell scripts which will "simulate" a Sputnik Inverter.
In "double quotes", because it its very simplified:
- Will wait on any incoming bytes 
- Won't do any check on these

It no longer uses a static but a checked response with randomized values for some of the params.
The montage and the check (length, checksum) of the message is done by chksum_smw.
You have to compile this program first by typing

gcc -o chksum_smw chksum_smw.c

in this directory.

Syntax:
./netcat_sputnik <port-to-use>

The example smw-logger.conf in this directory can be used with
./netcat_sputnik 12345
